- 👋 Hi, I’m @SooMash, a 25 year old Mechanical Engineer by training but made the switch to web developement about a year ago. Still a junior, but loving it!
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend development, but one day I aim to be truly full stack. I'm familiar with JavaScript, TyepScript, React.js, CSS, HTML and a little bit of Vue.js
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React Native, because I believe the future is only becoming more and more mobile-app focused.
- 💞️ I’m passionate about renewable energy and the power technology can have to accelarate the transition from non-renewables.
- 📫 How to reach me:
