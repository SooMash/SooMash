- 👋 Hi, I’m @SooMash, a 26 year old intermediate frontend software engineer. A Mechanical Engineer by training, and made the switch to software developement in the venture-building space mid-2021, and haven't looked back!
- 👀 I’m currently focusing on frontend development, but one day I aim to be truly full stack.
- 👷‍♂️ In my professional capacity I've worked with JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js,  Vue.js, CSS, HTML, SASS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Redux, Axios, Unit tests, SonarLint code quality assessments, GitHub Actions and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 1) React Native in my free time by building a fully fledged android mobile application using Android Studio and Expo, 2) the basics behind backend development, database management, API setup & architecture, 3) and all the while I am engaging in about product management & product strategy learnings in the context my current employment environment's access to countless innovative startups & products.
- 💞️ I’m VERY passionate about renewable energy and the power technology can have to accelarate the transition from non-renewables.
